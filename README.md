Read and write chat messages while your YouTube player is in fullscreen mode.

 - Messages appear as semi-transparent bubbles of text.
 - The message input area is invisible by default but shows up when you hover over the bottom area of the chat.
 - The overlay is on the left side of the screen by default, but can be moved by dragging the white box on the top-left of the overlay, and can be resized by dragging the resize widget on the bottom right of the overlay. (if it is too hard to see, hover your mouse around that area until the cursor changes into the resize cursor)
